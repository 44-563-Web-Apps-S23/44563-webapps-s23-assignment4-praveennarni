    <h4>THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE</h4>
    
    
         SCENE: _The living-room in the Mather home in Boston._
    
         TIME: _About 1700, an evening in early autumn._
    
         _Not so with_ MISTRESS BETTY. _Outwardly demure, yet inwardly
         rebellious against the straitened conventions of the times, she
         dimples over with roguish merriment upon the slightest
         provocation._
    
         _As we first see them_ COTTON _is giving_ BETTY _some timely
         advice_.<br>
    
    <h4 class="COTTON">COTTON.</h4> <p class="speech">But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
        reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
        fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.</p>

    
    <h4 class="Betty">BETTY.</h4> <p class="directions">[_Thoughtfully._]</p> <p class="speech">Truly reverend and most serious, father
        [_looking up roguishly_], but I like not so much of the grave about it.</p>

    
    <h4 class="COTTON">COTTON.</h4> <p class="directions">[_Continuing._]</p> <p class="speech">I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
        It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</p>

    
    <h4 class="BETTY">BETTY.</h4> <p class="directions">[_Protesting._]</p> <p class="speech">Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
        yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</p>
    
   
    <h4 class="COTTON">COTTON.</h4> <p class="speech">Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
        _thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
        for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>
   
    <h4 class="BETTY">BETTY.</h4> <p class="directions">[_Dropping her knitting._]</p> <p class="speech">Father, thou art not feeling well.
        Perhaps----</p>
    <h4 class="COTTON">COTTON.</h4> <p class="speech">Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
        be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
        I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
        go. </p>

    <h4 class="COTTON">COTTON.</h4> <p class="speech">he wicked stand in slippery places. It will not always be thus.
        Judgment shall come upon them.</p>

<h4 class="ADONIJAH">ADONIJAH.</h4> <p class="directions">[_Brimming over with self-satisfaction._]</p>  <p class="speech">That have I ever
sought to be.</p> 

<h4 class="ADONIJAH">ADONIJAH.</h4> <p class="directions">[_All puffed up._]</p> <p class="speech">Nay, others value it not. They be envious
of my good fortune.</p>

<h4 class="COTTON">COTTON.</h4> <p class="speech">A most prudent young man! Nay, be not so over-blushingly timid.<br>
    Thou'rt too modest.</p>
<h4 class="ADONIJAH">ADONIJAH.</h4> <p class="directions">[_His face falling._]</p> <p class="speech">But Betty--doth she regard me thus?</p>
<h4 class="COTTON">COTTON.</h4> <p class="speech">The ways of a maid are past finding out; but despair not. I
    think she hath thee much to heart, but, as the perverse heart of woman
    dictateth, behaveth much to the contrary.</p>
